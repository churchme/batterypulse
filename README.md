# batterypulse

BatteryPulse is an Android app designed to give haptic feedback about the user's battery levels while the screen is off and a device lift is detected.  The intended use to give a rough estimation of the remaining battery life without requiring the screen to be turned on.

This app is well known to be an additional drain to the battery :/
